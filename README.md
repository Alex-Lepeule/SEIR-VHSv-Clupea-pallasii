# SEIR-VHSv-Clupea-pallasii
A modified SEIR model to simulate the dynamic of the temperature dependent disease that is the viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus in pacific herring.

To start and estimate the parameters using a maximum likelihood model open the files names 'param estimates'. to match the parameters with the experimental data you will need to charge the .csv file named 'cumulative mortality' in this file you can find the value for the average cumulative mortality for each of the temperature tested. You can also find the standard deviation for each temperature. The results are from Hershberger et al. 2013. In the file named 'fitted parameters maximum likelihood' is the curves which represents the values of each parameter for the variation of temperature. 

Once each parameters are done you can go the the modeling part. first you will need to open the fil named 'all plot
